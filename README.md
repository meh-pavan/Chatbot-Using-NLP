# Chatbot with SQLite Logging

This project is a simple intent-based chatbot built in Python. The chatbot uses natural language processing techniques with NLTK for text processing, scikit-learn's TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression for intent classification, and SQLite for logging conversations.

## Features

- Predefined intents with multiple example phrases and responses
- Text preprocessing that removes punctuation, tokenizes, and lemmatizes input sentences
- TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features
- Logistic Regression classifier with a configurable confidence threshold to decide on responses
- Fallback mechanism when the classifier's confidence is too low
- SQLite database integration to log every conversation (including timestamps, user messages, and bot responses)
- Debug output for viewing probability distributions during predictions

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- sqlite3 (included with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


2. Change into the project directory:


3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:


4. Install the required packages:


If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install dependencies manually:


## Setup

The project automatically downloads the necessary NLTK packages (`punkt` and `wordnet`) on first run. Ensure you have an internet connection when you run the script for the first time.

## Usage

Run the chatbot script with:


Type your message and press Enter. To exit the chat, type `quit`. All conversations are logged in an SQLite database file named `chatbot.db` under the table `chat_logs`.

## Logging

Each conversation is stored in the `chat_logs` table with the following columns:
- id: Unique identifier for each record
- timestamp: Date and time when the conversation took place
- user_message: The user's message
- bot_response: The chatbot's response

## Debugging

For every user input, the script prints the probability distribution across the intents. This helps in understanding how the classifier interprets the input and aids in tuning the model. You can comment out or remove the debug print statement if you do not wish to see this output.
